# LDA-and-PCA-analysis
Through this project, I try to differentiate between a Supervised dimension reduction model and Unsupervised dimension reduction model and find the better algorithm for classification and efficient feature extraction for dimensionality reduction. I used Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for the two respectively.

I implement the classification on the IRIS dataset and reduce the dimensions of the data to 2, separately using both the methods.

Using MatplotLib, I plot the scatter plots for both the methods, which shows the difference between the implementation of the two algorithms.

In general, they both are dimension reducing techniques. But if we have labelled classes and want to discriminate in between the classes, then use LDA. However if we want to visualise the data without giving much emphasis to class labels and solely to study the variation in the data, then use PCA.
